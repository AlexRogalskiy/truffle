SEATTLE / June 7, 2019 -- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) announced today a partnership with [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), in which Truffle will integrate its developer tools with Microsoft Azure to bring quality developer experience and DevOps to enterprise blockchains. 

Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to make life easier for developers. With Truffle, users can access built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management. With more than [3 million downloads](https://truffleframework.com/dashboard) and a vibrant developer community, Truffle has long been an ecosystem favorite for new and experienced developers seeking the tools to expedite the smart contract and front end app development process. Truffle accelerated the growth of the open source Ethereum ecosystem as one of the first projects in [ConsenSys](http://consensys.net), and has since grown a dedicated following of users. With the successful integration of Truffle with [Quorum](http://www.goquorum.com/) and [Axoni’s](https://axoni.com/) AxCore, Truffle is setting its sights on global enterprise applications. 

Microsoft recently delivered an extension to Visual Studio Code that offers developers an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that leverages the best of the Truffle Suite and Azure Services. The extension allows developers to create and compile smart contracts, test them locally using the Ganache testing environment and inside Azure DevOps pipelines for private and public chains. Truffle’s integration streamlines enterprise DevOps and enables frictionless deployment to Azure. 

_"Early on it was very clear Ethereum developers needed professional, modern development tools. With enterprise’s growing adoption of blockchain technology, Truffle recognizes the importance of this opportunity to bring our blockchain-native experience to enterprise developers across the world through our partnership with Microsoft."_ Tim Coulter, Truffle CEO and Founder

Truffle Suite’s integration with Azure enables developers to build sophisticated, blockchain-based production systems that will be the future of enterprise IT infrastructure. Truffle Teams, announced last month, will enable enterprise IT teams to collaborate in developing blockchain solutions. Preferred integrations with Microsoft will soon enable smart contract developers to streamline their workflow and testing environments with direct GitHub integration, and deploy effortlessly on Azure. Truffle Teams enables developers to manage and monitor blockchain applications, detect anomalies, and analyze smart contracts as they are deployed in real time. Built on Microsoft Azure, and true to Truffle’s mission, Truffle Teams will remain free for open source users.

_"Our developers expect a world-class experience from Microsoft backed by the best of Azure and Open Source. The Truffle integration demonstrates our continued investment in working with the open source community. Integrating Truffle Suite with Visual Studio Code and Azure DevOps will deliver a world-class developer experience for customers targeting Azure Blockchain Service and public Ethereum."_ Marc Mercuri, Principal Program Manager, Azure Blockchain Engineering

Vice President of Strategic Partnerships Wesley McVay adds, _"By partnering with Microsoft, Truffle aims to elevate the experience of blockchain developers and provide them high-quality, enterprise-grade tools. Truffle is in a unique position to guide the enterprises that will ultimately drive enterprise clients and consumers towards the adoption of the decentralized systems of tomorrow. With a strategic partner like Microsoft, this vision is quickly becoming a reality."_

Truffle is one of the leading companies to come out of ConsenSys, the blockchain development and investment firm that recently invested $3 million in Truffle, supporting their expansion into the enterprise space.
