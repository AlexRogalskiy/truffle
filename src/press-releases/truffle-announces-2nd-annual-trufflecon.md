_The world’s most popular Ethereum developer tools suite, Truffle, will host its second annual developer conference in Redmond, WA._

**Redmond, WA / April 2, 2019**— Truffle is pleased to announce [TruffleCon 2019](http://www.trufflesuite.com/trufflecon2019), a conference for the users of Truffle, a suite of [tools for software developers](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), fans, and enthusiasts building decentralized applications powered by blockchain technologies.

The event, to be held August 2-4, will take place at Microsoft’s Redmond campus. Microsoft is the title sponsor of the event. This year’s TruffleCon is the second annual event for the Truffle community: those who actively build using Truffle’s framework for development on Ethereum. Programming will include speakers from the blockchain ecosystem, along with hands-on workshops geared toward novice users and expert builders alike.

TruffleCon places focus on the developer by exploring the many ways in which the Truffle tools can enhance the development process by increasing efficiency and enabling high quality DApp production.

Truffle is widely considered the most popular tool for blockchain application development with over 1.5 million lifetime downloads. Truffle supports developers across the full lifecycle of their projects, whether they are looking to build on Ethereum, Quorum, or one of an ever-growing list of other supported platforms. Paired with Ganache, a personal blockchain, and Drizzle, a frontend DApp development kit, the full Truffle suite of tools promises to be an end-to-end DApp development platform.

Tim Coulter, Truffle’s Founder & CEO, explained, "Developers attach their identity to the tools they're using. People are congregating around Truffle and want to learn from and collaborate with the people who are using the tools. We aim to host a conference where people can engage with their peers and share insights on how best to use the tool. We hope attendees will leave inspired and that the knowledge shared will transform how people build."

Liz Daldalian, Truffle’s Head of Operations, added, "We were blown away by last year’s event in Portland, Oregon. Over 200 developers came from around the world to share their challenges and successes with Truffle. Hearing about the world-changing applications being built with  Truffle tools is truly humbling. We walked away from the conference inspired and ready to start planning for 2019.”

An exciting lineup of collaborators and speakers will include Truffle engineers with more to be announced in the coming months.
